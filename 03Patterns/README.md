# Pattern Printing in Java

This folder contains various pattern printing problems solved using **Nested Loops**. These are essential for building logic and understanding loop flow control.

## Types of Patterns

### 1. Basic Patterns

Usually solved using nested `for` loops (outer loop for rows, inner loop for columns).

- **Simple Shapes**:
  - `First.java` to `Ninth.java` likely contain standard patterns like:
    - Solid Rectangle
    - Hollow Rectangle
    - Right Angle Triangle (Normal & Inverted)
    - Floyd's Triangle
    - Binary Triangle (0-1 Triangle)

### 2. Advanced Patterns

- **Rhombus Patterns**:
  - `Solid_Rhombus.java`: Prints a solid slanted rectangle.
  - `HollowRhomhus.java`: Prints the border of a rhombus.
- **Pyramids**:
  - `NumberPyramid.java`: Pyramid made of numbers.
  - `PalindromicPyramid.java`: Palindromic number arrangement (e.g., 2 1 2).
- **Complex Shapes**:
  - `Butterfly.java`: Mirroring triangle pattern resembling a butterfly.
  - `Diamond.java`: Combination of upper and lower pyramids to form a diamond.

## Key Concepts

- **Outer Loop**: Controls the number of rows.
- **Inner Loops**: Control the printing of spaces and stars/numbers within each row.
- **Logic**: Finding the relationship between the row number (`i`) and the columns (`j`).
