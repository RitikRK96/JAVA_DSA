# Java DSA Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! Here I document my progress and code solutions as I learn DSA using Java.

## 📚 Course Reference

I am following the comprehensive **Java DSA course taught by Shradha Khapra of Apna College**. My goal is to complete the entire curriculum and master these concepts.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topics/chapters:

-   **01Basics**: Introduction to Java, variables, data types, etc.
-   **02Loops**: Control flow, loops (for, while, do-while).
-   **03Patterns**: Pattern printing problems.
-   *(More topics will be added as I progress)*

## 🎯 Goals

-   [ ] Complete all course modules.
-   [ ] Solve practice problems for each topic.
-   [ ] Master fundamental and advanced DSA concepts in Java.

*Happy Coding!*
